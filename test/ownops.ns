#Write your own operators! There's no difference between 'operators' and
#'normal functions' in nscript. In fact, there's no difference between
#'functions' and variables. Everything is a variable, some variables
#are executable.

#Function names must simply not begin with a digit, ', ", &, $, # or {

#Here we write a '^' operator simply by assigning a block to the variable
#'^'. n p ^ consumes n and p and leaves pow(n, p) on the stack. Works only
#with whole number exponents.
#
#Remember that although we're calling this an 'operator', to nscript it's
#just a variable that's executable.

    #Put n on the stack p times, then multiply p times. We also put a 1 on 
    #the stack to allow for p = 0.

    &* p repeat
