Was made in a few hours, doesn't have most features you'd expect, is
buggy and messy. Still pretty fun though. :P

Building
--------
Run 'make' to build the library and test, 'make libnscript' to just
build the library, and 'make test' to just build the test. Run 'nstest'
to run the test executable.
