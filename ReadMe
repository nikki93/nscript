Was made in a few hours, doesn't have most features you'd expect, is
buggy and messy. Still pretty fun though. :P

Building 
-------- 
Run 'make' to build the library and interpreter, 'make libnscript'
to just build the library, and 'make ns' to build just the interpreter.

'ns' is the interpreter executable. You can run './ns < file' to run
the nscript code in 'file'. Try './ns < test/fib.ns'.
