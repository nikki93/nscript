nscript is a stack based scripting langauge. Check out the examples in
the 'test' directory.

Building 
-------- 
Run 'make' to build the library and interpreter, 'make libnscript'
to just build the library, and 'make ns' to build just the interpreter.

'ns' is the interpreter executable. You can run './ns < file' to run
the nscript code in 'file'. Try './ns < test/fib.ns'.
